Question: find min amount to be exchanged between students in order to equalize the student's cost
1. find average cost (need to round up)
2. find the upper largest cost and the lower largest cost.
3. output min largest cost

Remark:
1. average = ((int)(average * 100/n + 0.5)) / 100.0;
2. if(average < pay[i]) high_exchange += pay[i] - average;
3. if(average > pay[i]) low_exchange += average - pay[i];
4. if(high_exchange < low_exchange) printf("$%.2lf\n", high_exchange)
